# Our response to the fractureiser malware
## Initial actions
When we first heard reports of the malware, we took down all modpack releases as we couldn't know for sure our modpack was unaffected. We disabled auto updating of mods and informed our playerbase about the possible malware.
## What we do to reduce the possibility of compromised mods being distributed through our modpack
We use GitHub actions to build releases to prevent the modpack being infected before being uploaded to github. Signed commits are required and all admins use 2fa on their github account. Although what we can do to prevent malware being spread on the modpack level is limited, we still try our best to make sure our modpacks are free of malware. Supply chain attacks like this are often out of our control yet  we try to our best to prevent something like this from happening.
## Aftermath
After it was deemed safe to use Minecraft mods from Curseforge and Modrinth, we rebuilt the releases and everything went back to normal
